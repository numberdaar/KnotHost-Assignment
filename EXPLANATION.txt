KnotHost Case Studies - File and Function Guide

This document explains what each major file does and the role of key functions/components.

Root
- .gitignore: Excludes dependencies, build artifacts, editor/OS files, and env files from git.
- README.md: Quickstart, features, stack, and configuration notes.
- EXPLANATION.txt: This file; detailed guide to files and functions.

Client (React)
- client/package.json: Scripts and dependencies for the React app.
- client/index.html: HTML shell; React mounts on the element with id="root".
- client/tailwind.config.js: Tailwind content paths to purge unused styles.
- client/postcss.config.js: Enables tailwindcss and autoprefixer.
- client/src/index.css: Imports Tailwind layers (base, components, utilities).
- client/src/main.jsx: React entry; wraps the app in AuthProvider and StrictMode.
- client/src/auth.jsx: Provides authentication context and helpers.
  - AuthProvider: Loads token from localStorage on mount; exposes login/logout and isAuthenticated.
  - useAuth: Hook to access authentication state and methods.
- client/src/api.js: API helpers using axios.
  - signUp(email, password): Calls POST /api/auth/signup.
  - login(email, password): Calls POST /api/auth/login and returns a JWT token.
  - forgot(email): Calls POST /api/auth/forgot (simulated email).
  - me(token): Calls GET /api/auth/me with Authorization header.
- client/src/App.jsx: All pages, header, routing, and responsive mobile menu.
  - Layout: Header with desktop nav + mobile hamburger/side-drawer; shows Login/Logout based on auth.
  - Home: Hero section, services grid, and contact form section.
  - Services: Simple services overview page.
  - Contact: Contact info page.
  - Login: Submits credentials to API; on success stores token via context and navigates to Home.
  - Signup: Creates an account (simulated email confirmation) and navigates to Login.
  - Forgot: Sends a password reset request (simulated; prints token in server logs).
  - ProtectedPage: Example protected content; requires authentication, otherwise redirects to Login.

Server (Node + Express)
- server/package.json: Scripts (dev/start) and dependencies for the API.
- server/src/index.js: Express setup, middleware, and routes mounting.
  - CORS is enabled for http://localhost:5173 and JSON body parsing is on.
  - GET / returns a health info payload.
  - Mounts /api/auth router.
- server/src/routes/auth.js: In-memory authentication logic for demo purposes.
  - POST /signup: Creates user with a bcrypt password hash; logs a simulated confirmation email.
  - POST /login: Verifies credentials and returns a signed JWT token.
  - POST /forgot: Logs a simulated password reset token for the user.
  - GET /me: Validates JWT from Authorization header; returns user identity if valid.

How the pieces work together
- The client logs in using Login → api.login → receives token → AuthProvider.login saves it to localStorage and state.
- Layout reads isAuthenticated from context; immediately shows Dashboard + Logout without refresh.
- Protected routes use isAuthenticated and redirect to the login page when needed.
- Server stores users only in memory; restart clears users. JWT is signed using JWT_SECRET or a default dev key.

Notes
- Tailwind provides responsiveness (e.g., md:hidden for mobile/desktop toggling).
- NavLink underlines the active route on desktop and highlights the active item in mobile sidebar.
